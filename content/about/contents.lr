## The website

I have come to like static website generators, because they allow me to follow a workflow more similar to developing software, and the generated pages render extremely fast. I write my content in Markdown. 

Starting on February 7, 2021, I switched to [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com).

Between 2017 and 2021, this entire website was generated using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). For details about my workflow, read [this](/blog/generating-gergelim-using-hexo/).

Until December 2017, I generated it using [Frog](https://github.com/greghendershott/frog).

Before that, it used to run as an instance of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/), and was powered by [Express](https://expressjs.com/), a Web framework for Node.js, [Jade](https://jade-lang.com/), a Node template engine to generate the HTML, and [Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/), a CSS preprocessor.

_Gergelim_ is the Portuguese word for _Sesame_.

## Me

I am a software engineer in love with the process, not with the goal.

I believe in the value of Open Source software as an expression of freedom and creativity. Most if not all of my contributions are on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/sturmer).

My public GPG key is [0x39BBDB6C](/about/keygpg/).

I tweet from [@increatore](https://twitter.com/increatore), mostly about programming and books.

Most of what I've read is [here](https://www.librarycat.org/lib/sturmer).
