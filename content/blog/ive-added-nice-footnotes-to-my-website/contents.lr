Erm, Bigfoot for some reason stopped working... I've found an alternative and I'll try to fix my poor notes when I find time.

I often read [jamesclear.com](https://jamesclear.com), and I really like the way they do footnotes -- they're actually popups that appear when clicking on a button. I wanted to try something similar for this very website and ended up discovering the amazing `bigfoot.js`.

## Solution: hexo + hexo-footnotes + bigfoot

I was already using `hexo-footnotes`[^2], a hexo plugin that simplifies writing footnotes. When I want to write one, I do something like:

```js
Hey, this is a footnote[^1]!
```

and then somewhere else I write the content:

```md
[^1]: This is what you're going to read following the footnote.
```

This generates HTML looking like this:

```html
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
```

for the origin, and

```html
<div id="footnotes">
    <hr>
    <div id="footnotelist">
        <ol style="list-style:none; padding-left: 0;">
        <li id="fn:1">
            <span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; padding-right: 10px;">1.</span>
            <span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;">
            This is what you're going to read following the footnote.
            </span>
            <a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote"> â†©</a>
        </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
<div>
```

for the destination.

Now we need to install bigfoot. Here's what I've done, step by step:

1. Downloaded the bundle from the website[^1], and copied `bigfoot.min.js` into my theme's directory (`themes/landscape/source/js`), together with a minified version of jQuery.
2. Copied `bigfoot-default.css` into `themes/landscape/source/css`
3. Added `@import "bigfoot.css"` at the end of my main style file inside the css directory, `style.styl`

Now I just need to write the following snippet in the posts where I want to use it:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/bigfoot.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    $.bigfoot();
</script>
```

and use my footnotes exactly the way I did before. 

## Parting thoughts

You can see examples of the footnotes throughout this post. What I don't really like is that I need to repeat the `<script>` boilerplate in the files where I want to use bigfoot, and I am sure there's a more elegant and less repetitive way of doing it. Well, I'll leave it for next time for now.

Happy footnoting!

[^2]: I've also found that the project had out-of-date dependencies, so I created a PR for it. I've got low expectations for it to be merged soon, as the project seems to have been inactive in the last year, and there's no CONTRIBUTING-like file, nor does it seem easy to reach out to the author.
