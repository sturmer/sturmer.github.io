Hi guest! My name is Gianluca and this blog is part of [gergel.im](https://www.gergel.im "The Gergel.im Project"), my project of documenting my experiences with the C++ programming language. My objective is to consistently improve my C++ skills.

<!-- more -->

I blog as a practitioner and learner, and in no way as an expert. I hope to collect much feedback along the way: I believe that the primary tool to seriously learning C++ is:

1.  doing
1.  getting feedback about the output

In the long run,Â I hope that my notes can help my fellow learners and practitioners gain new perspectives and solve some of their problems.

Apart from actually working with C++ during my daily job, which provides me some experience on the field, my learning approach follows several concurrent paths:

- personal projects
- books
- programming snippets focused on specific features
- analysis of blogs and stackoverflow questions
- reading code: STL, Boost, and a pinch of protobuf are among my current readings

Be sure to keep in touch by following me via email subscription, RSS, Social Networks, or however you prefer.
