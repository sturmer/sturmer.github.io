##### Goal: Reading as much as possible

Good enough on this one. If I've counted right, I've read 4 books in this time. But I am writing less about them.

##### Goal: Learning Estonian and Russian

Taking a hiatus on these two. Finished my Estonian A1.1 but didn't enjoy the course format. I dropped out of the Russian one.

##### Goal: Make the Reading Ap√©ro popular in Estonia

This will take more work but I've done 3 already and there was people each time
