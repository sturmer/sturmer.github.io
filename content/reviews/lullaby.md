A pretty unnecessary crime story about a brutal infanticide. The nanny seems perfect (the alternative title to the book is _The Perfect Nanny_) but the reader understands that itâ€™s quite the contrary since the first lines of the book. The choice is a bit brave in that the beginning itself tells already the end of the story and the crude fact is even reported on some editionâ€™s covers. It doesnâ€™t matter though. The writer explores the dark in the life of Louise that leads her to the tragic gesture. Itâ€™s reasonably well-developed even though a few threads felt unresolved to me.

It surprised me that it won a Prix Goncourt ðŸ™„ and that for some reason, it was also acclaimed by [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/07/lullaby-by-leila-slimani-book-review). I wouldnâ€™t recommend it unless you want some easy but empty read.
