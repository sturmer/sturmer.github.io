A forgettable book about time travel that I’ve looked forward to reading for ages but turned out to be a disappointment. The main character goes to a ridiculously far-in-the-future year and all he finds is that the world is divided into two big tribes, one of weak fat-asses and another of nocturnal scary half-monsters that feed on the first and live underground (the Morlocks). Gets stuck for a while in the future, then escapes.

Not sure what was good about this book. I’ve got a soft spot for the Victorian era writing style but that’s it. I’ll relegate it mentally along with The Turn of the Screw, another big disappointment.
