I’ve been willing to read this book for a very long time, and it’s been a great experience. It’s the story of the early years of Trevor Noah, an incredibly gifted stand-up and all-around comedian from South Africa, and his struggles in the country where apartheid was developed and enforced. I didn’t expect the tragedy behind the origin of this guy and frankly, he deserves all my respect for putting this out into the world. A must-read memoir I’d recommend to anyone who wants to better understand South Africa and its struggle and its place in the world.
