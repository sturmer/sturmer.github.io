Boring story of a vampire. I had this old memory of the movie with Tom Cruise and the little girl that was turned into a vampire before reaching sexual maturity, which was her damnation. I remembered it as a good movie. But the book is boring. I was hoping to find some interesting theme behind the now boring clich√© of the vampire, but nope, my hopes were betrayed. Just stay away.
