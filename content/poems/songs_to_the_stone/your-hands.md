<pre id="song">
You had long, ugly, bony hands
Your knuckles were swollen
Your nails chewed up and ruined 

And yet I bear the mark of them on my face
From that day you landed to deliver bad news
And put your forehead against mine,
Closed your eyes, and put those hands,
    beautiful, graceful, slender,
On my grateful face
And I put mine on them because I couldn't believe you were there with me.

And how long we've stayed like that, 
With me worried of bystanders thinking we were crazy, 
But wasn't I? weren't you, just a bit?
The knots of my worry will strangle me one day.

When will that day come
when I'll be able to think of all that 
with just gratitude, and without the bitterness? 

I'm afraid that will be the day when the memory of you will be so faded 
that it will only remain as some dull background of cosmic pain that I can feel in my bones.
