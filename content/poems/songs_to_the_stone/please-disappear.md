<pre id="song">
I hope that city
I once fantasized about
disappears from the face of the Earth,
or at least from my memory altogether, which is the same, isn't it?

That whole country
and those few millions people
and their language and their traditions,
their loves and their perversions,
their movies and their culture
and what is left of the old empire
that thought it could rule the world: _disappear_.

I don't want to hear your name anymore.
Every person mentioning you
is my enemy and I want them to disappear too,
devoured by the endless void.

Every flower. Every house.
Every mother with her child,
Every husband with the love of his life.
Every smiling face
    over a drink in a bar
    on a quiet Saturday night, among friends.
Every self-righteous smug pretty woman who thinks
that they can twist my life
and drive me to my knees with pain.
I've let you in
and all you did was wreck. 

One day I'll only see the good parts;
but by then
I'll have forgotten all that matters,
because of how much it hurt _back then_,
and so when I'm calm enough
to see the beauty of it all,
I will be lacking every part of it
that made it beautiful.
