You had long, ugly, bony hands<br />
Your knuckles were swollen<br />
Your nails chewed up and ruined 

And yet I bear the mark of them on my face<br />
From that day you landed to deliver bad news<br />
And put your forehead against mine,<br />
Closed your eyes, and put those hands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beautiful, graceful, slender,<br />
On my grateful face<br />
And I put mine on them because I couldn't believe you were there with me.

And how long we've stayed like that,<br /> 
With me worried of bystanders thinking we were crazy,<br /> 
But wasn't I? weren't you, just a bit?<br />
The knots of my worry will strangle me one day.

When will that day come<br />
when I'll be able to think of all that<br /> 
with just gratitude, and without the bitterness? 

I'm afraid that will be the day when the memory of you will be so faded<br /> 
that it will only remain as some dull background of cosmic pain that I can feel in my bones.
