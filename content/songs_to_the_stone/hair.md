The last night we spent together<br /> 
I saw a hair of yours on the floor<br />
I could spell its color and knew who it belonged to<br />
And that was presence and I was happy<br />
In all the misery we shrouded ourselves into.

When you were gone<br />
From this latitude, from this life<br />
I couldn't muster the courage to clean my home<br />
I couldn't think of taking what was left of you<br />
Away from what little was left of me.

Days went by.<br />
The hair was tangled with dust<br />
And I noticed there were more<br />
I picked one up, straightened it in my hands<br />
Distrustful I put it under my nose in the pointless hope<br />
Of catching a faint whiff of that scent that had anointed me but a few days before.<br />
There was none. I couldn't believe it.

One day I cleaned the floor. With a heavy heart<br />
I let go of those last dead pieces of us.<br />
I was mistaken.<br />
There were more<br />
Surviving the vacuum<br />
Entangled in the textiles of the couch<br />
Hidden in a crease on the side of the bed<br />
Shorter, longer, all bearing the color of your mane<br />
With variations<br />
So different from mine. No one<br />
Has entered this house ever since. The memory of you<br />
Just doesn't want to go away<br />
And I want it to stay. I want it to stay.
