<pre id="song">
The last night we spent together 
I saw a hair of yours on the floor
I could spell its color and knew who it belonged to
And that was presence and I was happy
In all the misery we shrouded ourselves into.

When you were gone
From this latitude, from this life
I couldn't muster the courage to clean my home
I couldn't think of taking what was left of you
Away from what little was left of me.

Days went by.
The hair was tangled with dust
And I noticed there were more
I picked one up, straightened it in my hands
Distrustful I put it under my nose in the pointless hope
Of catching a faint whiff of that scent that had anointed me but a few days before.
There was none. I couldn't believe it.

One day I cleaned the floor. With a heavy heart
I let go of those last dead pieces of us.
I was mistaken.
There were more
Surviving the vacuum
Entangled in the textiles of the couch
Hidden in a crease on the side of the bed
Shorter, longer, all bearing the color of your mane
With variations
So different from mine. No one
Has entered this house ever since. The memory of you
Just doesn't want to go away
And I want it to stay. I want it to stay.
