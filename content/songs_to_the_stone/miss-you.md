For however much I may insult you and curse the memory of you<br />
The truth of it all is that I miss you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in ways I didn't think possible.

Fow however bad I think you can still do to me<br />
However devastating has been our time together<br />
It's still been the happiest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the most broken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've ever been.
