For however much I may insult you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and curse the memory of you<br />
The truth of it all is that I miss you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in ways I didn't think possible<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before meeting you.

Fow however much you can still hurt me<br />
However devastating our time together was<br />
It's still been the happiest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the most broken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've ever been.
