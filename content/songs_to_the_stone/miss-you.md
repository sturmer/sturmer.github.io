<pre id="song">
For however much I may insult you
    and curse the memory of you
The truth of it all is that I miss you
    in ways I didn't think possible
    before meeting you.

Fow however much you can still hurt me
However devastating our time together was
It's still been the happiest
    and the most broken
    I've ever been.
</pre>
