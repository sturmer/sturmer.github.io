      <h1>Your voice is music</h1>

      <p>Sometimes I look out of my window in the loneliness of the cold night and imagine you walking to me while I do. I can hear the sound of your voice saying <em>Hi</em>, and of mine answering <em>Hi</em> (one octave higher, because I’m in awe). I keep looking out, without turning, but my stare is on your reflection in the glass. Your voice is sensual, a caress to my sorry ears, a velvet drape.</p>

<p>You put your body against mine and your right arm holds my torso, your right hand on my left shoulder, as if you were holding on to your property. Oh, you know me well and you know what’s yours.</p>

<p>No one has ever made me feel blessed and whole the way you do. And this is not even you, but a ghost I summoned in my mind. May what you do to me be blessed for however long the universe has until it implodes.</p>
