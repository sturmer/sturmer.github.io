      <h1>Emptiness</h1>

      <pre id="song">
Maybe the condition for writing is a profound loneliness.
Certainly the longing is in me tonight,
But not the poetry. It's because

A meaninglessness has chewed on me the whole day
While a bit sick at home, in one more meeting,
I thought of the color of your skin,
Of the way you close your eyes when I find the point that hurts
and knead it to squeeze some happiness out
of you.

At what point will one word you whisper not be a command
that would make me give up everything, just
to see those eyes close again for me?
</pre>
