      <h1>Please, disappear</h1>

      <p>I hope that city<br />
I once fantasized about<br />
disappears from the face of the Earth,<br />
or at least from my memory altogether, which is the same, isn’t it?</p>

<p>That whole country<br />
and those few millions people<br />
and their language and their traditions,<br />
their loves and their perversions,<br />
their movies and their culture<br />
and what is left of the old empire<br />
that thought it could rule the world: <em>disappear</em>.</p>

<p>I don’t want to hear your name anymore.<br />
Every person mentioning you<br />
is my enemy and I want them to disappear too,<br />
devoured by the endless void.</p>

<p>Every flower. Every house.<br />
Every mother with her child,<br />
Every husband with the love of his life.<br />
Every smiling face<br />
    over a drink in a bar<br />
    on a quiet Saturday night, among friends.<br />
Every self-righteous smug pretty woman who thinks<br />
that they can twist my life<br />
and drive me to my knees with pain.<br />
I’ve let you in<br />
and all you did was wreck.</p>

<p>One day I’ll only see the good parts;<br />
but by then<br />
I’ll have forgotten all that matters,<br />
because of how much it hurt <em>back then</em>,<br />
and so when I’m calm enough<br />
to see the beauty of it all,<br />
I will be lacking every part of it<br />
that made it beautiful.</p>
