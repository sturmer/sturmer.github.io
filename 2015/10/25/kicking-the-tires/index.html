        <p>In the hot, cruel desert of this space, wind howled in solitude. A stone statue lay on the ground like a man asleep, succumbing to its own weight, mental and physical. For more than one year, no stirring. The sun shines on again today. A wanderer passes by on a camel, and looks at the strange statue. He swears that he saw it moving.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>I haven’t written a word on this blog since more than one year. I figured it was high time to make some effort to hammer it back into shape.</p>
<h2 id="The-long-hiatus-and-why-it-grew-so-strong"><a href="#The-long-hiatus-and-why-it-grew-so-strong" class="headerlink" title="The long hiatus, and why it grew so strong"></a>The long hiatus, and why it grew so strong</h2><p>I have spent some time thinking about the reasons for which I stopped updating the content. Laziness is a reason, of course; but also something deeper.</p>
<p>I had designed this blog in 2013 with the help of a good book, Antonio Cangiano’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1934356883/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1934356883&linkCode=as2&tag=gergelim07-21">Technical Blogging</a>. I idolized his words (as alas I do too often with too many maîtres à penser), and wanted to faithfully follow them. Now don’t take me wrong, I still think highly of Antonio as a colleague; only I came to the conclusion that his book was not really meant to suggest me this particular strategy, but that it was me instead who interpreted it that way.</p>
<p>One of his pieces of advice was to focus on one topic; and I decided, since for some obscure and uncontrollable fate I was knee-deep into C++, to write about that. The twist, since I recognize my lack of experience and expertise, was that I wanted to use the blog to document my findings and my efforts, and to be held accountable of some amount of progress, however marginal, but unstoppable. Ah that, that I love. <em>Constant growth</em>.</p>
<p>But then, expectedly, unexpected happened. I started having a hard time at work, from lack of challenges, among other boring things. And so C++ became, in my eye, the tool that I used during my daily job, and that I associated with the hard time and the stress and a lot of things which have nothing to do with the technology itself, but made me respect it less as a scaffold to build my spirit in the time I’ve got to strengthen my knowledge (because it is this I do every moment).</p>
<h2 id="Make-it-right"><a href="#Make-it-right" class="headerlink" title="Make it right"></a>Make it right</h2><p>I mixed two parts of reading and one part of living, and at some point I saw the truth. I was not growing. I was stuck for some reason; of course, I was missing out on the blog being an instrument of improvement, but I didn’t mind that at the moment. I was not growing because I was not explicitly planning for it. Because I was not fighting to make it happen, letting it go, for whatever definition of <em>it</em>. I needed to rebuild a sustainable process of growth, from its foundations. The spark of this revolution, by the way, was a talk at the ACCU conference, with the apt name <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//www.slideshare.net/petegoodliffe/becoming-a-better-programmer-47411490">Becoming a Better Programmer</a>, by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//www.goodliffe.net/">Pete Goodliffe</a>.</p>
<p>So I started thinking of a process to engineer improvement back into my day. I remembered reading something like Do 3 or 4 things, every day, for 12 weeks; then measure and adapt. I think it was Seth Godin, but later wasn’t able to find out. I needed to adapt this process to a day without predictable time tables, by making a very few assumptions; two, to be precise:</p>
<ol>
<li>I know when I enter the office, but I can’t be sure when I get out</li>
<li>I want to make sports to be mentally efficient</li>
</ol>
<p>I started with 2 things, then improved on that. So far it is going well. I use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//toggl.com/">Toggl</a> for time tracking, but this is just a detail. (It is serving me well though).</p>
<p>I manage to squeeze 2 45-minutes blocks, which I assign to an activity each; currently, it is reading <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/013409266X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=013409266X&linkCode=as2&tag=gergelim07-21">Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective</a> and learning <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>. I have started on August 24, 2015, and November 8 will mark the 12 weeks milestone, at which point I will measure the experience. I could not wait until then to squeeze in some other activity, and in my case, I kindly vexed myself with an additional 30-minute block a day of reading Josuttis’ <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0321623215/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&linkCode=as2">tutorial on the C++ Standard Library</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Thoughts"><a href="#Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Thoughts"></a>Thoughts</h2><p>This is a plan; sometimes, I don’t manage to follow it. But it is definitely better to have plan than not to, so I’ll stick with this, and only change my mind every 3 months or so. This helps me keep my focus, and not being drained away by all the shiny stuff I run into. It also helps me <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2015/06/19/why-successful-people-focus-on-the-bottom-end-of-the-funnel/">arrive at the end of the funnel</a>.</p>
<p><em>This is about my growth as an engineer</em>. One language does not define my activity; and I want to describe exactly that, the struggle, and not only presenting in my own way the results, that can be found in books.</p>
<p>This blog is part of a larger project, <a href="//www.gergel.im/">Gergelim</a>, which is my attempt at describing who I am by showing what I do, and by reflecting on the process. The information in the website, and the one on this blog, are meant to be grown like a plant, rather than to be thrown on a page with a date, and forgotten, and get stale, and stay partial, incomplete.</p>
<p>I have a couple of ideas to also improve the whole project, and they involve the transformation of the website into a wiki, to be kept together with the blog. Linearity and hyperlinks. More on this in later posts.</p>
