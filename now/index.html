  <h2>Now</h2>
  <p>What's happening right now, as of December 26th, 2020. For reflections on the past, see the page of <a href="../retrospectives.html">Retrospectives</a>.</p>
<h2>To the imaginary friend that I haven't seen in a while, asking me what is up:</h2>
<p>I've been working in a new company. It will be 8 months tomorrow. It's still great.</p>
<p>My life-long journey to becoming a good engineer is going on (it being life-long means that it will probably go on as long as I do, unless unexpected events). I'm focusing on prepping up for <em>feature leading</em> and <em>evangelism</em>.</p>
<p>Feature leading is a big experiment in holistic thinking, planning, and leading the development of a small feature and I'm very excited about it and humbled by the fact I'm allowed to experiment.</p>
<p>On the side of evangelism, I plan to write something interesting in the Elixir space. In the longer run, I intend to attend conferences and speak about interesting projects, but that's still far on the horizon.</p>
<p>I'm not running as much as in summer. I don't have much in the way of excuses, I'm just doing it less, at least for the winter.</p>
<p>The first batch of vaccines against COVID-19 has landed in Tallinn, so I guess I'll be able to plan trips again hopefully by the summer. It's lockdown time and I'm not going to bars or restaurants, just walking around. I plan to visit Italy, but not sure how soon.</p>
<h2>Work-related OKRs</h2>
<h3>Write technical post</h3>
<p>I haven't figured out on what yet, but it will come. Sure is about Elixir.</p>
<h3>Grasp Elixir</h3>
<ul>
<li>Read more books: on Phoenix and Ecto, to start with.</li>
<li>The Advent of Code 2020 has been a great accelerator of my understanding. I have lagged way behind with the problems but I want to work on all of them. My deadline is December 1st, 2021 :)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal OKRs</h2>
<h3>Write novel</h3>
<p>This is ambitious but I'm reading <em>On Writing</em> by Stephen King so it should come easily, right? :) The plan is at 1K words a day, for a novel of 180K words. If I have to scale it back to 500 words/day I'm still fine with it. King suggests to have a full book in a season, i.e., three months, so if everything goes according to plans I'll have a first draft by end of March. Fingers crossed.</p>
<h3>Improve Estonian</h3>
<p>I'm pushing on doing three lessons per week, and I plan to keep pushing.</p>
<h3>Improve Russian</h3>
<p>I got back on studying Russian and I'm glad I did. Also here, three 30-minutes lessons a week.</p>
<h3>Listen to more music</h3>
<p>I've subscribed to Spotify Premium and I pledged to explore music. The strategy is to listen to at least one piece every day from an artist I don't know (or even an unknown piece from one I know). I've been doing it for a couple of weeks already and it feels great.</p>
<h2>Books</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/sturmer">My Goodreads profile</a> says all about what I'm reading these days. I'm usually glad to accept friend requests if we know each other.</li>
<li>The first book I've owned was <em>Treasure Island</em>. I'm not sure I've ever read it all. It was the unexpected and unwelcome gift of some idiot family friend who, however, actually made a good gift. I had just turned 8.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.librarything.com/catalog/sturmer">I've read 300+ books</a> between August 5, 1989 and today - click the link and select the "Read" filter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonus: I have a <a href="https://www.librarycat.org/lib/sturmer">TinyCat page</a></p>
<h2>Me (a.k.a. The Mug)</h2>
<p>I look like this today:</p>
