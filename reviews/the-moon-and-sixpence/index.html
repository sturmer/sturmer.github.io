<p>TL; DR: This book is a damn masterpiece.</p>

<p><em>The Moon and Sixpence</em> is the story of one Charles Strickland, a 40-year-old man with a boring job in finance and a perfectly happy bourgeois life, that one day decides to leave everything he has, including job and family, to become a painter. No explanation, no remorse, no anticipation. The story, it seems, is inspired by Paul Gauguin’s life (but I have no idea to which extent).</p>

<p>The story is told by one of the painter’s acquaintances, a doctor turned writer, after Strickland’s death, and describes their relationship from Strickland’s beginnings in Paris, via his miserable life in Marseille, until his end in Tahiti.</p>

<p>Apart from a few horribly sexist remarks (which however I tend to read as applying to the English society of the time), the author’s reflections on the human condition feel incredibly accurate. Somerset Maugham is a fine observer of the human soul and its torments, and too many times I’ve had to stop reading to ask myself whether I recognized myself in one of the descriptions, and too many I actually have.</p>

<p>The character of Strickland is brilliant, a true force of nature: a man who stops caring about everything in the world, and sacrifices himself and everyone he meets, in his supreme search of Beauty.</p>

<p>All the characters are extremely vivid and the story is a frantic page-turner from beginning to end. A book I won’t stop recommending to anyone.</p>
