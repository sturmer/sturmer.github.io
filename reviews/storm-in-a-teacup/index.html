    <p>I like the idea of books about scientific divulgation. I didn’t really like this one though. I’m somehow familiar with many of the principles described, so most of the book felt trivial. I also have issues with the structure of the chapters: talk about some real-life phenomenon, spruce it up with some biographical information, make another, completely different (yet somehow related) example, then try to bring all the examples together by showing that the underlying fundamental physics law applies and explains them all. This makes for a very fragmented story.</p>

<p>Read it if you have no idea of physics and like the style that you can find sometimes in TV documentaries; look for something different otherwise.</p>
