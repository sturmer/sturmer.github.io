    <p>An interesting book that challenged my perception of the weekend and has given me a couple of ideas on how to make sure that I use those two days to recharge the batteries.</p>

<p>It starts off as a history of the work week and of the week-end, as a documented essayist would write it, and that as expected I found a bit boring. Then it reflects on the current literature on the subject and common sense to point out what elements would make a good week-end. It proved to be also a stirring discussion about what we, as humans, face when we are idle, our fears of being useless, of wasting time, of looking at ourselves. An important read.</p>
