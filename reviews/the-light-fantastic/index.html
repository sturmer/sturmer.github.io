    <p>Took me some more pages to start appreciating the humor behind Terry Pratchett’s Discworld series, or maybe the story actually got better, God knows. Fact is, I liked this one and I’d definitely recommend it to friends and foes.</p>

<p>This time, Rincewind and Twoflowers face a threat from outer space represented by a mysterious red star that seems to be approaching Discworld (or rather, The Great A’Tuin, on whose back the world stands, seems to be going towards it). It is also interesting that this story concludes a micro story arc started in the first volume, opening to new possibilities.</p>

<p>Enticing.</p>
