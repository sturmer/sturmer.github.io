    <p>I don’t usually cry on books. It doesn’t depend much on the content itself, I guess. I like sad books, for some reason. Maybe it’s because they feel very real. By the end of this one, though, I had to put it down two or three times because I was sobbing violently.</p>

<p>It’s a very touching reflection on life and death, which happens to be one of my favorite subjects. Its author, Paul Kalanithi, was a medical student and practitioner who was a few steps away from becoming a neurosurgeon. But at around the age of 35, he got lung cancer. He started writing this book after learning his diagnosis.</p>

<p>He reflects on the reasons that led him to choose to become a doctor first, and then specifically a neurosurgeon. He reflects on what makes us humans what we are, and on what makes a life worth living.</p>

<p>Read it as a powerful reminder of what your life is about.</p>
