<p>Three things made this book interesting to me. The first is that it was mentioned by an asshole in a movie I’ve seen recently to justify his being what he was. The second is an underlying philosophy whose main tenet is that people should always only do what they do out of self-interest, and that if this were the case we’d live in a better (and more efficient, and happier) world. The third is this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/flannery-oconnor-reading-list">comment by Flannery O’Connor</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope you don’t have friends who recommend Ayn Rand to you. The fiction of Ayn Rand is as low as you can get re fiction. I hope you picked it up off the floor of the subway and threw it in the nearest garbage pail. She makes Mickey Spillane look like Dostoevsky.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is, in brief, a work that stirs strong reactions.</p>
<p>I happen to have liked it a lot. It’s written very cleverly, even though this is not the reason I liked it. It was more like reading someone who didn’t really care of making her content more digestible to the occasional reader. Maybe it was this, and now I’m a bit embarrassed: feeling part of a clique.</p>
<p>But I think that the thing that really made it a great read was the moment in time when this came into my life. I’ve always struggled with protecting my self-interest, sometimes to the point that I put other people’s happiness in front of mine, and this has made my life harder many times. And I thought that maybe if everyone were strong and we all knew that we don’t need to attend to the happiness of other people, because each one would do their best to achieve it, then how liberating would that be?</p>
<p>It’s a story about being excellent in one’s craft. Maybe a bit too much, to the point of being made a pariah and not being able to be anything outside of one’s job. The job as a call. It’s all very poetic and one is willing to suspend disbelief and see how things would be in a life spent according to this iron rule. The result is certainly interesting. I recommend it.</p>
