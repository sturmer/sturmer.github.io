    <p>Short but powerful masterpiece. It’s a slice of the life of a thirty-year-old software engineer in the French public administration, on the eve of a series of seminars he’s tasked to have in a few locations for the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>

<p>He’s brutally honest about the futility of his job and his life among his peers, in his society. He depicts a cold-hearted, petty group of people among which often he finds himself unwillingly. His description of sentimental relationships and their profound lack of balance, that leaves some people alone and desperate, resonate very much with some tendencies toward nothingness that all of us experience at some point in our lives.</p>

<p>Can’t recommend enough.</p>
