    <p>An attempt at making references to many ideas from the 80s. I understand the whole revival of the 80s but frankly, this felt like a useless story. I didn’t enjoy it, even though it was a compelling page-turner. Let me explain: I <em>wanted</em> to know how the whole thing evolved, so I kept reading, but at the same time I didn’t feel any real interest while doing it.</p>

<p>It’s the story of a dystopic future where humanity is on the brink of extinction, and the best that desperate people can do is find shelter for their mind in virtual reality, which is a projection in the future of something like World of Warcraft done well but totally immersive. The protagonist has no reserve when it comes to waste away his days in this fictitious world, which would have maybe given this work a chance. The virtual world’s creator launches a treasure hunt and the hero wins it against all odds and notwithstanding mega-corporations chasing him and his friends.</p>
