  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>I contribute to Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects with the goal of being part of a community, honing my engineering and communication skills, learning new ones, and teaching whenever I can.</p>
<p><strong>Update (2020/06/24)</strong>: I'm working for a new company and I've started to talk about the possibility of contributing to FOSS.
<strong>Update (2019/06/30)</strong>: I'm spending roughly 20% of my working time to work on FOSS. My main focus is on Superset.
<strong>Update (2018/08/11)</strong>: I don't invest much time on contributing, but I'm trying to do it while working for my employer. More soon (hopefully).</p>

<h1>Older contributions</h1>
<h2><a href="https://exercism.io/">exercism</a></h2>
<p>I have contributed by creating some problems for the Racket track in exercism:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/exercism/xracket/pull/27">Implement ETL</a>: ETL consists basically of a hash table inversion: given a table "score -&gt; list of letters", build a table "letter -&gt; score".</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/exercism/xracket/pull/25">Add the accumulate problem</a>: <em>Accumulate</em> is another way of calling what the <code>foldl</code> function does in Racket (also called <em>reduce</em> in functional programming): Obtain a scalar value out of a list by applying a function to each element and updating (accumulating) the result at each step. <strong>Note (2020-06-24)</strong>: For some reason it appears that this implements <em>map</em> instead, but I don't remember why it was called accumulate...</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://www.rethinkdb.com/">RethinkDB</a></h2>
<p>RethinkDB is a NoSQL database engine written in C++. I wanted to get my feet wet contributing to a big C++ project, but lost my interest after the first contribution.</p>
<p><strong>Update (2017-12-10)</strong>: <a href="https://rethinkdb.com/blog/rethinkdb-joins-linux-foundation/">The project has been revived</a>
<strong>Update (2017-02-01)</strong>: <a href="https://www.defstartup.org/2017/01/18/why-rethinkdb-failed.html">The project has been shut down</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/3078">Fix #3040</a>: From the release notes of 1.16.0 (Stand By Me): "Adjusted the formatting of log levels, no longer print info: lines to stderr and added a notice log level"</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://www.debian.org">Debian</a></h2>
<p>For a brief period (circa one year, in 2013) I have contributed to the Debian operating system by maintaining a very small package, cil.</p>
<p><a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/cil">Cil</a> is a text-based issue tracker written in Perl.</p>
