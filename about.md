## The website

I have come to like static website generators, because they allow me to follow a workflow more similar to developing software, and the generated pages render extremely fast. I write my content in Markdown. For details about my workflow, read [this](/2017/12/10/generating-gergelim-using-hexo/).

Since December 2017, this entire website is generated using [Hexo](//hexo.io/), and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](//pages.github.com/).

Until December 2017, I generated it using [Frog](//github.com/greghendershott/frog).

Before that, it used to run as an instance of [Node.js](//nodejs.org/) with [MongoDB](//www.mongodb.org/), and was powered by [Express](//expressjs.com/), a Web framework for Node.js, [Jade](//jade-lang.com/), a Node template engine to generate the HTML, and [Stylus](//learnboost.github.io/stylus/), a CSS preprocessor.

_Gergelim_ is the Portuguese word for _Sesame_.

## Me

![Me (2020-12-23 16:59)](/images/now/me-now-2020-12-23-16.59.jpg)

I am a software engineer in love with the process, not with the goal.

I believe in the value of Open Source software as an expression of freedom and creativity. Most if not all of my contributions are on [GitHub](//www.github.com/sturmer).

My public GPG key is [0x39BBDB6C](//www.gergel.im/key.gpg).

I tweet from [@increatore](https://twitter.com/increatore), mostly about programming and books.

Most of what I've read is [here](//www.librarycat.org/lib/sturmer).
