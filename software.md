I contribute to Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects with the goal of being part of a community, honing my engineering and communication skills, learning new ones, and teaching whenever I can.

**Update (2020/06/24)**: I'm working for a new company and I've started to talk about the possibility of contributing to FOSS.
**Update (2019/06/30)**: I'm spending roughly 20% of my working time to work on FOSS. My main focus is on Superset.
**Update (2018/08/11)**: I don't invest much time on contributing, but I'm trying to do it while working for my employer. More soon (hopefully).

# Older contributions

## [exercism](//exercism.io/)

I have contributed by creating some problems for the Racket track in exercism:

- [Implement ETL](//github.com/exercism/xracket/pull/27): ETL consists basically of a hash table inversion: given a table "score -> list of letters", build a table "letter -> score".
- [Add the accumulate problem](//github.com/exercism/xracket/pull/25): _Accumulate_ is another way of calling what the `foldl` function does in Racket (also called _reduce_ in functional programming): Obtain a scalar value out of a list by applying a function to each element and updating (accumulating) the result at each step. **Note (2020-06-24)**: For some reason it appears that this implements _map_ instead, but I don't remember why it was called accumulate...

## [RethinkDB](//www.rethinkdb.com/)

RethinkDB is a NoSQL database engine written in C++. I wanted to get my feet wet contributing to a big C++ project, but lost my interest after the first contribution.

**Update (2017-12-10)**: [The project has been revived](//rethinkdb.com/blog/rethinkdb-joins-linux-foundation/)
**Update (2017-02-01)**: [The project has been shut down](//www.defstartup.org/2017/01/18/why-rethinkdb-failed.html).

- [Fix #3040](//github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/3078): From the release notes of 1.16.0 (Stand By Me): "Adjusted the formatting of log levels, no longer print info: lines to stderr and added a notice log level"

## [Debian](//www.debian.org)

For a brief period (circa one year, in 2013) I have contributed to the Debian operating system by maintaining a very small package, cil.

[Cil](//tracker.debian.org/pkg/cil) is a text-based issue tracker written in Perl.

- [0.07.00-5](//tracker.debian.org/news/154171)
