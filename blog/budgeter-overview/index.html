<p>To practice a bit with React and Node.js, not long ago I've started writing a small application with the tentative name of Budgeter. It's been a serious attempt at starting something and consider it finished. I've learned a few things and I want to start writing about them in a series of posts.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>Here's a tentative, rough layout of what I want to talk about. Some of them are strictly technical, but at least one is more philosophical and deals with the definition of "done" and its approximation.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../how-to-finish-projects/">Lessons learned: How to finish projects</a></li>
<li>Setup a development environment with Express and React with option to deploy to Heroku</li>
<li>Deal with authentication "by hand" and JSON Web Tokens</li>
<li>Managing states with reducers in React</li>
<li>Use a chain of middlewares in Express to achieve something</li>
<li>Using Bootstrap and Reactstrap and why we need the latter</li>
<li>Future development</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Random factoid: I'd logged 27 hours and 30' when I considered the first milestone completed and put the project in the open</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The repository is available on <a href="https://github.com/sturmer/capital">GitHub</a>.</p>
