  <p>Hi guest! My name is Gianluca and this blog is part of <a href="https://www.gergel.im" title="The Gergel.im Project">gergel.im</a>, my project of documenting my experiences with the C++ programming language. My objective is to consistently improve my C++ skills.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>I blog as a practitioner and learner, and in no way as an expert. I hope to collect much feedback along the way: I believe that the primary tool to seriously learning C++ is:</p>
<ol>
<li>doing</li>
<li>getting feedback about the output</li>
</ol>
<p>In the long run, I hope that my notes can help my fellow learners and practitioners gain new perspectives and solve some of their problems.</p>
<p>Apart from actually working with C++ during my daily job, which provides me some experience on the field, my learning approach follows several concurrent paths:</p>
<ul>
<li>personal projects</li>
<li>books</li>
<li>programming snippets focused on specific features</li>
<li>analysis of blogs and stackoverflow questions</li>
<li>reading code: STL, Boost, and a pinch of protobuf are among my current readings</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to keep in touch by following me via email subscription, RSS, Social Networks, or however you prefer.</p>
