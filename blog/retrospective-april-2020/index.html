  <h5>Goal: Write a budget application</h5>
<p>I consider this one achieved!</p>
<p>It was pretty cool. The end result looks very amateurish but I'm pretty proud for trying something totally new and bring it to some sort of completion.</p>
<p>I haven't decided yet whether or not I'll go on playing with it, but I admit that my enthusiasm has faded. I'll take some time to think about it.</p>
<h5>Goal: Write the same budget application with Rails or Spring Boot</h5>
<p>Not started. Will I ever start it? I gave myself a few months, and only one has passed. But as said above, my enthusiasm has declined. I'll think about it.</p>
<h5>Goal: Practice puzzle problems with my long-lost and recently-found-again love, Java</h5>
<p>I've done a lot before starting the new job, but now I see this as marginal as I saw it before. I recognize its important, but I just can't see how to fit it in my schedule -- especially if it needs to steal time from side-projects and experiments.</p>
