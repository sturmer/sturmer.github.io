  <h5>Goal: Getting back in shape with problem-solving</h5>
<p><strong>What I wanted to do:</strong> <em>Lately, I've reflected on side projects and career growth in general. Often I want to start some side project without having a real problem that I want solved. In the long run, this deprives me of motivation and I end up giving up.</em></p>
<p><em>I want to stay open to start one project when I feel I've got something interesting to develop, but I don't want to create yet another implementation of a solved problem (it was a markdown parser last time).</em></p>
<p><em>Programming contests offer problems that don't require weeks of work but can be worked on in a single session (30-120 minutes). I'll stick to them for a while.</em></p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> ❌ Haven't solved a single problem. <em>Lesson</em>: if I don't see value in this, I'll never allocate time to do it. Open source still makes more sense.</p>
<h5>Goal: Focused courses on PluralSight</h5>
<p><strong>What I wanted to do:</strong> <em>I'm trying PluralSight because I've seen a <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/nodejs-advanced">very interesting and to-the-point course on Node</a>. My experience with books has been pretty negative recently, so I want to see if it gets better with the course format. I'm going through the very thorough <a href="https://learndocker.online/">Learn Docker course</a> and if feels like I'm learning valuable things that help me doing my day-to-day job.</em></p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong>
✅ I have finished the Node course and gotten a better understanding of Node. I appreciate the instructor's care about the learner's retention and suggesting to go back to the lectures that I feel less confident about. I'll try to do that but I'm pessimist about me actually managing to.</p>
<p>❌ I've somehow abandoned the Docker course for lack of interest but I might get back to it as Docker is a useful tool.</p>
