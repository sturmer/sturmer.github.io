<p>I've read this book as a self-help one. I wanted to convince myself that I needed to cut a part of my free time in order to contribute to FOSS (Free and Open Source Software). I didn't need much convincing, neither did I need most of the technical knowledge; in any case, the book doesn't go into much technical detail. What it is good for is in framing the value of contributions in order to advance one's own career.</p>
<p>The take-aways for me were:</p>
<ul>
<li>How and why to compile a list of goals to follow when selecting a project to contribute to</li>
<li>A few legal details:<ul>
<li>Does my company allow me to work on FOSS in my own time on their equipment?</li>
<li>Do I have ideological preferences on which license I demand the project has before a move a finger to contribute to it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A few organizational ones:<ul>
<li>Look for projects that make it clear how to contribute and facilitate the process for new joiners</li>
<li>The onion structure of FOSS projects</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of the pages were dull to me. I recommend it as a nice recap of what you need to start contributing. If you know most of the stuff already, you can skip it and get to work instead.</p>
