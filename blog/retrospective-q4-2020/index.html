  <p>I didn't establish OKRs (and didn't update the Now page), so this will be a quick recap.</p>
<h3>Grasp Elixir</h3>
<p>I've finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50689973-real-time-phoenix">Real-Time Phoenix</a> by Stephen Bussey and practiced a lot during and thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/sturmer/aoc-2020/">Advent of Code 2020</a>. I'm not exactly <em>proud</em> of the code I've written but it's been very useful in finding out about many unfamiliar concepts.</p>
<h3>Improve Estonian</h3>
<p>I've done flashcards almost daily and tried to keep doing three 30-minutes study sessions on Keeleklikk. I can't complain</p>
<h3>Running</h3>
<p>I haven't run much this quarter but I plan to get back during the next one.</p>
