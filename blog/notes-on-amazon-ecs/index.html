  <p>Here are some notes I've taken while reading <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-blocks-of-amazon-ecs/">Building Blocks of Amazon ECS</a>.</p>

<h2>Regions and Availability Zones (AZs)</h2>
<p>AWS is divided into <em>regions</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are geographically separated</li>
<li>Each consists of multiple isolated data centers.</li>
</ul>
<p>A region is divided into (≥ 2) <em>Availability Zones</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>AZs are isolated from each other, but inter-connected via fast network connections.</li>
<li>One AZ can span more data centers. Common failures in one AZ don't affect other AZs in the same region, making outages of a whole region more rare.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get more availability, deploy a service over multiple AZs.</p>
<h2>Containers</h2>
<p>A container virtualizes an operating system, while a Virtual Machine virtualizes physical hardware. This means that a container <em>is not</em> a VM.</p>
<p>A (container) <em>image</em> is a package that groups</p>
<ul>
<li>the code of the application we want to run</li>
<li>and all the application's dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Images can be deployed on any host machine. The container takes care of the communication with the host.</p>
<p>ECS allows running containerized applications on a cluster of EC2 instances (that are the containers' hosts). ECS works natively with Docker containers.</p>
<h2>Container instances</h2>
<p>An ECS instance is a special EC2 instance that</p>
<ul>
<li>runs an ECS container agent</li>
<li>has an IAM policy and role (IAM is Amazon's identity management system)</li>
<li>is registered into our ECS cluster</li>
</ul>
<p>An <em>ECS task</em> is a group of containers. They logically belong together in order to make up an application/system. Tasks are not created directly, but through a task definition, that declares which containers belong to the task.</p>
<p>The <em>ECS container agent</em> is a program that handles communication between the (ECS) scheduler (the component that manages the ECS tasks) and the ECS instances. The <em>ECS scheduler</em> decides on which instance a container runs, according to some user-specifiable constraints.</p>
<p>An <em>ECS cluster</em> is a group of container instances inside a region (but possibly, and preferably, across multiple AZs).</p>
<p>To register an instance in a cluster, the instance needs an agent running.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>A service is a way of automating the concept of what to run. Conceptually, it looks like: "I want N tasks, defined by task definition D". This recipe is processed by the ECS infrastructure, that makes sure that those tasks are running, possibly restarting them if they go down.</p>
