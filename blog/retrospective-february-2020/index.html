  <h5>Goal: Keep reading, but also write reviews and get better at them (how?)</h5>
<p>I've read a lot in February, also because I've been traveling. Haven't figured how to write good reviews yet, but I want to keep thinking about it.</p>
<h5>Goal: Write fiction</h5>
<p>I think this month I've finally decided I don't want to ever write fiction any more. I've reflected long and hard about this in my private journal and won't report more here, but the gist is that I confuse my passion for reading and stories, even telling stories (in contexts different from writing novels, as in, essays, technical documentation, <em>et cetera</em>), with a passion to imagine fictions. I've tried it, several times, and it's mostly painful. I've come back on this decision so many times during my life that I can't exclude I'll change my mind later.</p>
<h5>Goal: Study Racket</h5>
<p>I have given up a bit on this as I'd like to understand better the technologies that are tangent to the ones I use. Racket is great but I figured that getting on to React might prove more useful in the shorter term. Pluralsight is still my go-to resource for this kind of interest, but I was reading with interest <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/continue/index.html#%28part._.Inspecting_.Requests%29">Continue: Web Applications in Racket</a>.</p>
