  <h5>Goal: Reading as much as possible</h5>
<p>Good enough on this one. If I've counted right, I've read 4 books in this time. But I am writing less about them.</p>
<h5>Goal: Learning Estonian and Russian</h5>
<p>Taking a hiatus on these two. Finished my Estonian A1.1 but didn't enjoy the course format. I dropped out of the Russian one.</p>
<h5>Goal: Make the Reading Apéro popular in Estonia</h5>
<p>This will take more work but I've done 3 already and there was people each time</p>
